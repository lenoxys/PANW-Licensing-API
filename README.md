# PANW-Licensing-API
To successfully license firewalls that do not have direct internet access, Palo Alto Networks provides a licensing API. You can use this API with a custom script or an orchestration service to register auth codes, retrieve licenses attached to an auth code, renew licenses, and to deactivate all licenses on a VM-Series firewall
